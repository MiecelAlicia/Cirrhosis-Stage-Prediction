# Cirrhosis Stage Prediction (ML Exam Project 1)

This project uses the '1A.tsv' dataset to build a classification model that predicts the stage of cirrhosis in patients based on clinical and demographic features.

## ðŸ§  Overview
The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) to predict the 'Stage' variable.

## ðŸ§® Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find correlations between features and the target variable.
- Model training and evaluation using classifiers.
- Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of cirrhosis stage.
